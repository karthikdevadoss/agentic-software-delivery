# Lessons

Durable, reusable technical lessons discovered and verified while building
this project — not architecture decisions (see DECISIONS.md) and not
current state (see PROJECT_STATE.json). Keep entries short and reusable;
this is not a session diary. Add a new entry only when a real failure or
surprising verified behavior would otherwise get rediscovered later.

- **Claude Sonnet 5 returns thinking blocks by default; never assume
  `content[0]` is text.** A response's content list can start with a
  `thinking` block before any `text`/`tool_use` block. Always filter
  content blocks by `.type` explicitly; never index positionally. (Caused
  a real crash in V1: `message.content[0].text` raised `AttributeError`
  because block 0 was a `ThinkingBlock`.)

- **Every `tool_use` block in one assistant turn needs a matching
  `tool_result` in the very next user turn — none can be skipped or
  deferred.** If a safety limit (like a tool-call budget) is reached
  mid-batch, return a synthetic error `tool_result` for the excess calls
  instead of omitting them, or the conversation becomes invalid.

- **`stop_reason` alone is not a reliable "should I stop calling tools"
  signal.** A `max_tokens` cutoff can still carry a complete, valid
  `tool_use` block that must be executed. Gate tool-loop continuation on
  the presence of `tool_use` blocks in the response, not on
  `stop_reason == "tool_use"` specifically.

- **A hardcoded git-log snapshot inside a doc goes stale by construction**
  — a commit can't record its own hash in its own content before it
  exists. Prefer one durable fact (e.g. `last_verified_code_commit` in
  PROJECT_STATE.json) plus "run `git log` yourself" over embedding a log
  snapshot anywhere.

- **Windows drive-relative paths (e.g. `C:foo`, no leading slash) are not
  flagged by `pathlib.Path.is_absolute()`.** Verified empirically that
  `REPO_ROOT / "C:foo"` on the same drive resolves safely inside the repo
  anyway (harmless), but don't assume Windows path edge cases behave like
  POSIX — verify with a quick empirical probe rather than reasoning from
  POSIX intuition alone.

- **Maven Wrapper generation and first run both require network access**
  (the wrapper plugin itself, then the actual Maven distribution zip on
  first `mvnw` invocation). Don't assume `mvnw` is fully offline-capable
  out of the box in a fresh environment.
